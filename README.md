# ⚙️ boolean-algebra

This repository has code that helps with Karnaugh maps, truth tables, and boolean algebra. 

## Purpose

The problems in my boolean algebra class were quite boring. The hard part is not making a small mistake in any of the steps,
but it's easy to use python to check intermidate results. There is python code to workout truth tables, logical equivalence, kmaps, and more. Most methods print results, as I used this to assist with written homework and practice. 

## Features

- Support for user defined boolean functions in python
- 2 to 4 Variable kmaps
- Filling truth tables
- Getting every combo with Weighted Code or BCD
- Binary itterator
- SOP or POS from min/max terms
